# Lab | MLOps Deployment from PROD to DEV

## Steps Taken

1. **Created Repository**:
   - I began by creating a new repository on GitHub Desktop to store my project files and track changes.

2. **Created `test3.py` File**:
   - I added a Python file named `test3.py` to the repository for testing purposes.

3. **Opened Git Bash**:
   - I launched Git Bash to work with Git commands directly from the terminal.

4. **Created a Virtual Environment**:
   - In the project directory, I created a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
     ```bash
     python -m venv env_name
     ```

5. **Installed Necessary Packages**:
   - With the virtual environment activated, I installed the packages required for the lab. For example:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas
     ```

6. **Created the `requirements.txt` Document**:
   - I generated a `requirements.txt` file with the installed packages to document the dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip freeze > requirements.txt
     ```

7. **Initialized the Repository, Added Files, and Committed Changes**:
   - In Git Bash, I initialized the repository, added the files, and committed the changes:
     ```bash
     git init
     git add .
     git commit -m "Initial commit with test3.py and requirements.txt"
     ```

8. **Shared Repository Link with Partner**:
   - I shared the repository link with my partner, Dani, to collaborate. Dani used this link to create a pull request.

9. **Repository Link**:
   - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/cbertopt/test3)

10. **Dani Forked and Modified the Repository**:
    - Dani forked my repository, made a modification to the `README.md`, and then created a pull request for the changes.

11. **Merged Pull Request**:
    - I reviewed Dani's modifications and approved the pull request. After merging, the collaboration was complete.

## Using GitHub Desktop and Git Bash

### GitHub Desktop
I utilized GitHub Desktop to track and commit my changes visually, allowing me to push updates seamlessly to GitHub.

### Git Bash
For command-line control, I used Git Bash to perform Git operations such as initializing the repository, adding files, committing changes, and managing pull requests.
